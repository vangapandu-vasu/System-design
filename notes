System design :
  Dns resolutions:
    actually dns holds the ip addresses and domain name like ip address of amazon and amazon
    so whenever your are requesting to a server, it mean u r not requesting to server u are requesting to dns and dns gives u the ip address and your are searching the ip address not the name.
  vertical scaling:
    increasing your resources like cpu ram is know to be vertical scaling.
    increasing or adding more resoures to your single processor or machine
    drawback in vertical scaling:
      it takes down time to add up resources, down time mean the server will be down to add up the resources because you cannot add the cpu or ram while running.
  horizontal scaling:
    to avoid down time we will use horizontal scaling which incearses the servers not add up the resources to one server 
    as the users inceases we will increase the servers but here every server as a different ip address so the dns gives the first server ip to the users so whats the point in different servers when you cant redirect 
    users to other servers.
