Perfect. Here's a 30-day System Design Roadmap tailored for SDE interviews (suitable for product-based companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.) and designed for 1–2 hours/day commitment.

🗺️ SYSTEM DESIGN ROADMAP FOR SDE INTERVIEW (30 Days)
Days	Topics / Tasks	Notes
Day 1	Introduction to System Design
- HLD vs LLD
- Functional vs Non-functional	Clear the foundation
Day 2	Basics of Scalability, Availability, Reliability, Maintainability	Core principles
Day 3	Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
Monolith vs Microservices	Tradeoffs understanding
Day 4	Load Balancer – Concept, types, real-world use	Draw diagrams
Day 5	Caching – Redis, Memcached, LRU Cache	Include eviction policies
Day 6	Database Design Basics – ER Models, Normalization, Indexing	SQL focus
Day 7	NoSQL – Types (Key-Value, Document, Column, Graph), use-cases	MongoDB, Cassandra
Day 8	CAP Theorem, BASE vs ACID	Core for DB decisions
Day 9	Sharding and Replication	For scaling DBs
Day 10	Consistent Hashing – use in distributed systems	Use diagrams
Day 11	CDN (Content Delivery Network)	Akamai, Cloudflare
Day 12	Message Queues – Kafka, RabbitMQ	For async communication
Day 13	Rate Limiting and Throttling	Leaky bucket, token bucket
Day 14	API Design Principles – REST, versioning, authentication	HATEOAS, JWT
Day 15	Authentication & Authorization – OAuth, JWT, Sessions
🧪 PROJECT PHASE – HLD Practice (Days 16–30)
Each project is designed to give real interview-level experience.

Day	Project
Day 16-17	✅ Design URL Shortener (bit.ly): unique short URLs, DB, cache
Day 18-19	📬 Design Rate Limiter: IP/user-based rate limiting
Day 20-21	💬 Design Chat System: 1-1 messaging, WebSockets, storage
Day 22-23	📸 Design Instagram: Posts, Likes, Comments, Feed
Day 24-25	📺 Design YouTube: Upload, stream, recommend videos
Day 26-27	🛒 Design E-commerce System: Orders, payments, inventory
Day 28	🔐 Design Auth System: Email OTP, login, reset password
Day 29	📚 Revise Core Concepts (Caching, Load Balancers, DB choices)
Day 30	✅ Mock Interview Prep: Explain one system end-to-end to yourself

📌 Tips for SDE Interviews
Think in terms of trade-offs: speed vs consistency, availability vs complexity.

Always start with requirements: functional & non-functional.

Draw a block diagram on whiteboard/paper before jumping into design.

Talk aloud during interviews: explain your thinking clearly.

🧠 Want to Level Up Even More?
Here’s what you can do now (only if you're aiming for very top interviews like Google, Uber, etc.):

Learn trade-offs better: SQL vs NoSQL, consistency vs availability.

Study design patterns (Circuit breaker, Bulkhead, etc.).

Try mock designing complex systems:

Design Instagram stories

Design WhatsApp messaging

Design Google Docs collaboration

Add a few AWS/Azure/GCP diagrams to explain services when needed.

Read 2–3 system design case studies like:
